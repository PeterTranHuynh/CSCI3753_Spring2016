Inspired by work from Chris Wailes - 2010

With help from:
Junho Ahn - 2012

Various files adopted from other exiting work.
See file comments for specific details and references.

---Dependencies---
fuse-utils
openssl
attr
attr-dev
libfuse-dev
libssl1.0.0 or libssl0.9.8
libssl-dev

Note: To use extended attributes (xattr) on EXT filesystems,
      you must add the 'user_xattr' mount option to the
      mount options of any mounts on which you intend to use 
      extended attributes. Failure to so may result in an error
      when trying to set, get, or remove xattr values.

---Files---
Makefile         - GNU makefile to build all relevant code
README           - This file
fusexmp.c        - Basic FUSE mirrored filesystem example (mirrors /)
aes-crypt.h      - Basic AES file encryption library interface
aes-crypt.c      - Basic AES file encryption library implementation

---Executables---
pa5-encfs      - Mounting executable for root (\) mirror FUSE filesystem example

---Examples---

***Building***

Build All:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

***FUSE Examples***

Make a directory
 mkdir <Folder>

Mount fusexmp on existing directories and list (ls) mirrored root directory (/)
 ./pa5-encfs <Encryption Key> <Mirror Directory> <Mount Directory>
 ls <Mount Directory>

Write into a file, or create and write into a file
 echo "<INPUT>" > <File Path>

Read a file
 cat <File Path>

Unmount a FUSE filesystem
 fusermount -u <Mount Directory>
